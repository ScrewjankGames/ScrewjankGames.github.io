Hi, I'm Nicolas LaCognata. I'm a recent college graduate and aspiring Gameplay Programmer. This is my blog, where I'll do write-ups about whatever I happen to be working on. No one's paying me money right now, so in the mean-time I'm developing the [Screwjank Engine](https://github.com/screwjankGames/ScrewjankEngine/) to keep my skills sharp and maybe make something worthwhile. 

I wouldn't be half the programmer I am today without all the free information I've found on the internet, so I'd like to do my part and throw some more out there. I'll try to target my posts at people like me, starting down the barrel of some new task they want to figure out but don't understand. 

If you like what you see, or have any questions about anything I've written, feel free to [email me](mailto:nicolacognata@gmail.com) or [follow me on the twitter I've never used](https://twitter.com/mr_lever).
